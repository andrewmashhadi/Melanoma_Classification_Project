# SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification Project
## Identifying melanoma from lesion images


Based on Kaggle competition here: *https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/siim-isic-melanoma-classification/overview/description*

Goal is to identify melanoma in images of skin lesions. In particular, we want to use images within the same patient and determine which are likely to represent a melanoma. Using patient-level contextual information may help the development of image analysis tools, which could better support clinical dermatologists.

Melanoma is a deadly disease, but if caught early, most melanomas can be cured with minor surgery. Image analysis tools that automate the diagnosis of melanoma will improve dermatologists' diagnostic accuracy. Better detection of melanoma has the opportunity to positively impact millions of people.
