ResNet-152 Finetuning

Using 5 Epochs, 3 linear (layers 300 neurons to 100 neurons to 1 neuron), 1D batch-normalization, dropout layers with p=0.3, and a 0.001 weight-decay (L2 regularization) ...

- ROC AUC reached 0.887
- Validation loss plateaued 


Notes:

- Accidentally counted half-epochs as full epochs, so this will need to be updated.
