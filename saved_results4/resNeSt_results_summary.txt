ResNeSt Finetuning

Used 20 Epochs, 3 linear (layers 1024 neurons to 256 neurons to 1 neuron), 1D batch-normalization, dropout layers with p=0.4 and p=0.3, and a 0 weight-decay (L2 regularization) ...

- ROC AUC reached 0.882
- Validation loss did not seem to plateau yet.


Notes:

- Started with same settings as ResNet50
- Then tried increasing layer size *
- Now trying a single layer
