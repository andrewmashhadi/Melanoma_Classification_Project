ResNeSt Finetuning

Using only 3 Epochs, 3 linear (layers 300 neurons to 100 neurons to 1 neuron), 1D batch-normalization, dropout layers with p=0.3, and a 0.001 weight-decay (L2 regularization) ...

- ROC AUC reached 0.86
- Validation loss did not seem to plateau yet.


Notes:

- Started with same settings as ResNet50
