ResNeSt Finetuning

Used 7 Epochs, 2 linear layers (fully connected layer to 512 neurons to 1 neuron), 1D batch-normalization, dropout layers with p=0.4 and p=0.3, and a 0 weight-decay (L2 regularization) ...

- ROC AUC reached 0.886
- Validation loss did not seem to plateau yet.


Notes:

- Started with same settings as ResNet50
- Then tried increasing layer size (1024 to 256 to 1)
- Then tried a single layer (good, but just slightly less than 3 layer)
- Tried 2 layer, and this came up with best results so far (see above)
- Found potential bug that associated the optimizer with only the nets fully connected layer. Technically this is not the same as feature extraction. Not exactly sure what this may have affect. Moving forward, I will remove this bug.
